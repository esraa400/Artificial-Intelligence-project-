<h1>future of Artificial intelligence</h1>
<img src="future.jpg" alt="image">
<br>
In the next 10 years technologies in narrow fields such as speech recognition willcontinue to improve and will reach human levels.

 
In 10 years AI will be able to communicate with humans in unstructured English usingtext or voice, navigate (not perfectly) in an unprepared environment and will have somerudimentary common sense (and domain-specific intelligence).

 
We will recreate some parts of the human (animal) brain in silicon. The feasibility of thisis demonstrated by tentative hippocampus experiments in rats. There are two major projects aiming for human brain simulation, CCortex and IBM Blue Brain.

 
There will be an increasing number of practical applications based on digitally recreatedaspects human intelligence, such as cognition, perception, rehearsal learning, or learning by repetitive practice.

 
The development of meaningful artificial intelligence will require that machines acquiresome variant of human consciousness.

 
Systems that do not possess self-awareness and sentience will at best always be very brittle.

 
Without these uniquely human characteristics, truly useful and powerful assistants willremain a goal to achieve. To be sure, advances in hardware, storage, parallel processingarchitectures will enable ever greater leaps in functionality

 
Systems that are able to demonstrate conclusively that they possess self awareness,language skills, surface, shallow and deep knowledge about the world around them andtheir role within it will be needed going forward.

 
However the field of artificial consciousness remains in its infancy.

 
The early years of the 21st century should see dramatic strides forward in this areahowever.
